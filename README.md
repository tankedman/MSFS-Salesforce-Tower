# MSFS-Salesforce-Tower
Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in San Francisco, towering over the city at a height of 1070 feet. Completed in 2018, it was built too recently for addition to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. This freeware mod brings this iconic building and other significant elements of the San Francisco Skyline to MSFS!
This scenery add-on for MSFS 2020 also includes part of the South of Market district (SoMa), with buildings never before present in the game such as the Transbay Transit Center and the iconic 181 Fremont skyscraper. 
This release includes the use of LODs, optimizing framerate. Further optimizations will be made in the future.
*This addon uses photogrametry from Google Maps, edited and cleaned up in Blender.

Please do not hesitate to contact me to report any issues!


Release v0.3:
Known Issues to be fixed soon:
- Photogrametry color is a bit bright and needs to match the rest of the bing maps scenery
